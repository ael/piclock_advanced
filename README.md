### PiClock Advanced
Clock / Infoscreen for radiostudios  
Basically this is just a modified Version of this one: (https://github.com/jdgwarren/pirsclockfull)

You can see a clock with the typical LED ring for the seconds and some areas for signalisation of different things like onair, phone, door. You can configure the text easily on your own. 
If the mic is open, also a talk timer ist counting up. It stops as soon as the mic is closed. If the mic is opened the next time, the timer will be reset and starts counting up again.
In the top left corner there is also an indicatior, that shows which studio or source is currently broadcasting. In our case we get this information from the audio router. If the on air studio corresponds with the studio the current infoscreen is associated to, the colour changes from red font on black backgound to white font on red background. But this is configurable
On the bottom you can show the songinformation of the song that ist currently playing, or also something else. You just have to set the right path.
Currently there is also an indicator with the name "Pegel" which stands for the audio level. It has no function yet. Maybe it's possible to get the audio level of the associated studio via a small USB soundcard and let the indicator light up if the audio level is to high. I haven't looked into that, but would be nice.
