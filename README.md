### PiClock Advanced
Clock / Infoscreen for radiostudios  
Basically this is just a modified Version of this one: (https://github.com/jdgwarren/pirsclockfull)

You can see a clock with the typical LED ring for the seconds and some areas for signalisation of different things like onair, phone, door. You can configure the text easily on your own. 
Also planned is a timer which tells you how long the mic was opened.
I also want an indicator, that tells you, which studio is the onair studio, or rather the source that is currently broadcasting.
And some information about the currently played title or the broadcasted RDS info.
